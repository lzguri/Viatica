CURRENT LIST 
ed meds next
1) thrombocytopenia hyperkalmeia detected doesnt get home meds but if its manually htere it gets it all unclear why.

(A) isn't detect3ed as abnoral 

for hypokalemia it doesnt tell us to check magnesiaum 

checking missing also not working always still with hypokalmemia 
2) other labs in the abrnmoal labs not detecing/showitng
3) If NSTEMI dont need CAD


6) remove nan after labs that dont have a unit
7) sometimes the lab print this way AST of 28.0 U/L, ALT of 31.0 U/L and Lipase of 27.0 U/L.Lactate of 2.7 mmol/L, 


initial show_abnormal_labs (trop, albumin, phosphorus, amylase) 

other labs is special 

hyperphosphatemia missed

[completed] ed meds given

"ordered": whatever's left

XX unremarkable

in one case INR remarkable but not getting it 


may be particular to abnormal labs

sitll saying chekc stuff we havent gotte

meeting next friday (June 30) to work on an acute condition

FOR TOMORROW 6/30
CARDIOLOGY MODULE

NSTEMI
Unstable angina
Acute heart failure
Atrial fibrillation, atrial fibrillation with rvr
Atrial flutter with rvr/supraventricular tachycardia
Ventricular tachycardia/Ventricular fibrillation
Syncope
Bradycardia/AV block <---  same plan
Acute pericarditis
Infective endocarditis



cardiac_profile = [troponin]
heart_failure = [probnp - GFR, BMI, Age]
kidney function = [GFR, CREAT] compare with previous
electrolytes = [K, MG]
inflammatory_markers = [ESR,CRP]

ACUTE HEART FAILURE
ASSESSMENT --> static can be obtained from all_conditions_ultimate
if corrected_sodium low --> prognostic sign
home_meds [same as chronic congestive heart failure] --> compliance ***
contraindication and caution
low sodium diet --> compliance
last TSH, FeSat
if albumin =< 3.5 --> contributing to volume overload
associated_conditions = CAD, HTN, Aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, MS, HCM
has the patient been diagnosed with OSA
atrial fibrillation - well controlled or not - HR
if cardiac cath has shown any coronary artery disease
cardiac_profile
electrolytes = if k>4 and Mg > 2, print - electrolytes WNL
if the patient has ICD --> interrogate ICD

PLAN
static plan should be obtained from all_condition_ultimate
if lasix --> switch to lasix IV
if bumex or torsemide --> cont or switch to bumex
if k <4 print - K level and give K, target ~ 4
if Mg < 4 - MG level and give MG, target ~ 2
Rx iron deficiency anemia = iimproves functional capacity and quality of life
smoking cessation


NSTEMI
ASSESSMENT
static assessment as in all_conditions
home meds --> coronary artery disease
contraindications/caution
TIMI score --> needs to be calculated
cardiac_profile
if K and MG low --> under plan replace, target K ~ 4, MG ~ 2
Associated conditions -->
PLAN
check missing labs should be fixed
heparin --> need check if the patient is on blood thinners already [might need to do it wo bolus if on blood thinners]
nitroglycerin --> need to make sure patient is not on PDE inhibitors [Erectile Dysfunction indications]
if on statins --> need to make sure they are high-dose statins like atorvastatin or rosuvastatin --> need to be switched to high dose thats not the case
check if the patient is bradycardic --> start metoprolol or if the patient is already on beta-blockers other than metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, switch to metoprolol
if smoking in the history --> counsel about smoking

Anemia
Hgb of 9.3 g/dL [Last Hgb was 9.9 on 02/08/2023], Hct of 31.0 % and MCV of 90.9 fL.
Vit. B12 of 468.0 pg/mL, Ferritin of 211.4 ng/mL, <--- same format as above but it should show date [ group old labs]
Associated conditions: IDA
No signs of bleeding
Home meds: ferrous sulfate
Caution: rivaroxaban
Plan
- Cont. ferrous sulfate
- Cont/Hold*** rivaroxaban and warfarin
Check [if nothing check - remove]
- Monitor for now


- in front of everything from plan

looking up condition Anemia vs anemia shouldnt give different output

Anemia
Hgb of 9.3 g/dL [Last Hgb was 9.9 on 02/08/2023], Hct of 31.0 % and MCV of 90.9 fL.
Vit. B12 of 468.0 pg/mL, Ferritin of 211.4 ng/mL [3/4/2020]
Home meds: Ferrous sulfate
Cautioned: Rivaroxaban
Contraindicated: 
Associated conditions: IDA
No signs of bleeding
Plan
- Cont Ferrous sulfate
- Monitor for now


if contraindication --> Hold ferrous sulfate
if caution --> Cont/Hold ** ferrous sulfate


Coronary artery disease
Home: clopidogrel
Plan
- Cont/Hold *** clopidogrel [anemia] <---
- Hol

remember medications json looks for dierect case sensitive matches with names other than the chronic disease 
make only first comma for disease detected case insensitive for medications

manually adding lines doesnt always detect the labs like when its autogenerated


7/14/2023

HYPERKALEMIA

if K >= 6.5:
- Insulin + dextrose if glucose > 250
- Calcium gluconate
- Lokelma
- Nephrology consult
 
 if ESRD --> nephrology consult for dialysis

 if acute heart failure, anasarca, nephrotic syndrome, liver cirrhosis --> furosemide

 if not in DKA, ESRD, and bicarb < 18 --> Start bicarbonate drip


 DIABETIC ketoacidosis

ASSESSMENT

if Glucose > 600 or Blood osm > 320 --> possible overlap with HHS
Acid-base disorder: pH, Bicarb, AG
Electrolytes: Na, Mg, K, GFR [compare], CREAT
Blood ketones, urine ketones
Urinalysis: 
h/o type 1 DM, chronic pancreatitis
Precipitating factors: NSTEMI, UTI, Acute pyelonephritis, Acute pancreatitis

Plan

if pH < 6.9, start bicarb drip [might worsen hypokalemia]
if K < 3.4 --> hold Insulin, K needs to be replaced first [K is level]
If K >3.3 and less than < 5.3 --> IV fluids supplemented with K [20-30 mEq/L]
if glucose < 250 --> start Dextrose supplementation [D5W] otherwise - When serum glucose is 200-250 add D5W to IV fluids

Added renal transplant and neuropathy module --> needs to be conmpleted
