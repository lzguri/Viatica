COPD exacerbation 
- ASSESSMENT [remove on final assessment]
C/o *** [static, needs to be input manually]
CXR showing *** [static, needs to be input manually]
PFTs ***, previous sputum culture *** [recommended for frequent exacerbations]
Current smoker or previous smoker [pack-year] *** [static, needs to be input manually]
Labs: PHBLOODPOC, PO2POC, PCO2POC, O2SATPOC [CO2 from CMP or BMP] [this should be pulled from the chart automatically]
Labs: WBC, PROBNPNTERMI [this should be pulled from the chart automatically]
Labs: INFLUENZAA, INFLUENZAB, COVID19, RSVAG [this should be pulled from the chart automatically]
Home meds: SABA, LABA, LAMA, SAMA, roflumilast, [this should be pulled from the chart automatically]
Chronic azithromycin therapy [checks prolonged QTc in the chart] and/or PO prednisone at home [this should be pulled from the chart automatically]
- PLAN
- IV methylprednisolone [static] [create a function, if DM, monitor glucose]
- Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs [static]
- Start Rx with *** [static, antibiotic]
- O2 supp., SpO2 target ~ 88-92 %
- if pH is < 7.3 and PaCO2 > 50 --> repeat blood gas [create a function that does this]
- Telemetry monitoring [static]
- Nicotine patch [current smoker, no NSTEMI or limb ischemia] [static]

Other things to consider
LDCT as outpatient to screen for lung cancer
if not responding --> IV Mg 2 mg over 20 mins --> bronchodilator by counteracting calcium influx to the cells [this will be input at a later date as recommendations]


IF INFLUENZA POSITIVE [ doesnt need to be in pulmonary, can be in infectious disease as a separate entity]
Influenza
positive by PCR
Plan
- Start Rx with tamiflu [renally dosed if GFR < 60, create a function for this]
- Droplet precautions

if COVID-19 positive --> start Rx with dexamethasone [if DM --> monitor closely glucose level] and remdesivir [monitor kidney function], droplet and contact precaution

COPD [chronic] [omit if COPD exacerbation present]
Not in exacerbation
Home oxygen use: *** [static, needs to be input by user]
Home meds: SABA, LABA, LAMA, SAMA, roflumilast, [this should be pulled from the chart automatically]
Chronic azithromycin therapy [checks prolonged QTc] and/or PO prednisone [this should be pulled from the chart automatically]
Plan
- cont with home meds [funciton cont or hold]

converting brand to generic, so if u search for a class u may get the brand
maybe implement a function that does this for brands to generic.
