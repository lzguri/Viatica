Acute kidney injury
- compare current Creat with previous Creat [Increase in SCr to 1.5 to 1.9 times baseline within 7 days or ≥0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/L) within 48 h]
^ if no previous say "AKI presumed (no previous Cr)"
^ if ESRD in hx it's a seperate plan, dialysis "plan for ESRD- call nephro"
^ say GFR was xxxx last time is now xxxx, same with Cr for 1-2 weeks ago etc 
- print current Creat [GFR], previous Creat
- print BUN/Creat. K level, Bicarb level [Anion gap]
^ if > 20:1 then prerenal, just give the Ratio..
(BUN increases as kindye funciton drops), print K level, what's bicarb
- CPK level, urine Cr, urine Na [calculate FeUrea if on diuretics otherwise FeNa] ????
^ if we have, otherwise say to check the level 
- Urinw protein, Blood dipstick, urine WBC/RBC
^If above not availabel say to eheck UA 
- checks if WBC casts, RBC casts, Hyaline casts ???
^Bring up if UA available. 
- imaging --> look for hydronephrosis, inc. in kidney echogenicity, size
^imaging is diff stage
^Say US kinday, CT abdomen showigng ***, let dr input themselves 
- meds: ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, diuretics, TMP-SMX, colbicistat, cimetidine
^lits will be updates, but say to hold these if they are there in meds list 
- risk factors: DM, CKD, HTN, SLE
- If Pmhx of CKD with AKI, say "AKI on CKD"
Plan
- Cr. AM
- hold meds from above
- IV fluids or not ***
- imaging if not done
- nephrology consult
- check missing labs
- check urinalysis if not present 
^output these things onto one line, check workup reference, 

use names in the workup refernece, inclduing the units.. 
group things as written above


* build function that uses drugs.json for classes -> specific drugs 
* function that says switch to liek atorvastatin if they are on *** 



Chronic kidney disease
- already done, omit if AKI present, say plan as above
End-stage renal disease
- add Nephrology consult to CKD plan

Hyponatremia
- if corrected sodium < 135 mEq/L
- corrected sodium for hyperglycemia --> pseudohyponatremia if corrected sodium is within range and measures sodium is < 135
- acute if it happened within 48hrs otherwise presumed chronic
- severity of hyponatremia [ severe < 120, moderate 120-129, mild 130-134]
- symptomatic or not***
- euvolemic, hypovolemic, hypervolemia [liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, heart failure]
- current sodium level, previous sodium level date
- TSH level, uric acid level, BUN level, blood osmolality 
- urine Na, urine osmolality 
- brain mass, hemorrhage --> needs more aggressive Rx
- alcohol abuse?
- meds: SSRI, TCA, carbamazepine, valproic acid, thiazode-diuretics
Plan
- check BMP every 6 hrs for severe hyponatremia
- hold meds:
- nephrology consult if severe hyponatremia
- check missing labs

Hypernatremia
Hyperkalemia
Hypokalemia
Hypomagnesemia
